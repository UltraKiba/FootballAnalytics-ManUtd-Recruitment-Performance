    "The primary objective of this case study is to conduct an in-depth analysis of Manchester United Football Club’s recent recruitment strategies and on-pitch performance. By leveraging publicly available data and established analytical frameworks, this study aims to identify key challenges and propose data-driven, actionable strategies for improvement. This analysis is specifically designed to showcase advanced data analytic skills, strategic thinking, and a deep understanding of the football industry, making it a relevant piece for potential employers in sports analytics and data-focused organizations."

    "### Context\n",
    "Manchester United, a club with a storied history and global fanbase, has faced significant challenges in maintaining its competitive edge in the post-Sir Alex Ferguson era. Despite substantial financial investment, on-pitch performances have often fallen short of expectations, leading to frequent managerial changes and scrutiny of its operational structure, particularly in player recruitment and tactical execution. The English Premier League, and European football at large, has become increasingly competitive, with rivals successfully integrating data analytics into their decision-making processes to optimize performance and gain strategic advantages. This case study explores how Manchester United can navigate these modern challenges."

    "Data analytics has revolutionized modern football, extending far beyond simple performance metrics. Today, it encompasses sophisticated approaches to talent identification and recruitment, opposition analysis, in-game tactical adjustments, player development, injury prevention, and fan engagement. Clubs that effectively harness data are better positioned to make informed decisions, optimize resource allocation, and ultimately achieve sustainable success. This case study will demonstrate the practical application of data analytics in addressing specific issues within Manchester United, highlighting how a data-centric approach can bridge the gap between legacy and innovation."

We will use data from sources like FBRef, Transfermarkt, and Opta (via publicly available aggregators) to inform this analysis. The pasted content provides initial figures for players like Antony, Højlund, Fernandes, Martínez, Onana, and Sancho, which will be expanded upon."

    "*   **Lisandro Martínez (2022)**: Signed for a reported £47m-£57m. The provided data indicates strong defensive metrics (4.3 tackles/90, top 5% PL defenders). Further analysis would involve comparing his pre-signing Ajax metrics (e.g., progressive passes, aerial duel success rate for his height, ball recoveries) against United’s defensive needs at the time. His ability to play out from the back and his aggressive defending style were likely key data points aligning with the manager's desired tactical setup.\n",
    "*   **André Onana (2023)**: Signed for a reported £44m. His 7.2 long passes/90 directly supported Ten Hag’s build-up play. A deeper dive would analyze his save percentage above expected (xG conceded vs. goals allowed), distribution accuracy under pressure, and frequency of defensive actions outside the penalty area, benchmarking these against other top goalkeepers and United's previous keepers."

His 0.2 key passes/90 in 2023-24 (as per provided data) and low overall goal contributions represent a significant underperformance relative to his cost and Bundesliga reputation. Analysis would explore if his underlying metrics in Germany (e.g., shot quality, xA, dribble success rate in final third) were sustainable or system-dependent, and whether a data-driven approach might have flagged potential adaptation risks.\n",
    "*   **Antony (2022)**: Signed for £85m. His 0.8 dribbles completed/90 (ranked 42nd among PL wingers) and £1.4M per goal/assist are alarming. A data-focused recruitment approach might have questioned the sustainability of his Eredivisie output, analyzed his decision-making in the final third (e.g., shot selection, cross accuracy), and compared him against other, potentially better-value wingers with similar profiles using a broader dataset."
